Instructions
  Open the index.html file. I use chrome, and have tested the game on mozilla. Both workcorrectly.
  The main code is in the file game.js in the js folder.
  
  The objective of the game is to get the mouse out of the maze 
  and collect all the cheese. Stay away from the monsters, they can kill you. You can also
  kill the monsters, just hit them with the red ball.
  Use the arrow key to move around, bump into the cheeses to collect them.
  
  The game also have sound now.
